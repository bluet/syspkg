  Base snaps are a specific type of snap that include libraries and
  dependencies common to many applications. They provide a consistent and
  reliable execution environment for the snap packages that use them.
  
  This core base snap additionally includes the snapd binaries, which in
  later releases are installed separately as the snapd snap. For more details
  on the snapd snap, see https://snapcraft.io/snapd.
  
  The core base snap provides a runtime environment based on Ubuntu 16.04 ESM
  (Xenial Xerus).
  
  Other Ubuntu environment base snaps include:
  -   Core 18: <https://snapcraft.io/core18>
  -   Core 20: <https://snapcraft.io/core20>
  -   Core 22: <https://snapcraft.io/core22>
  -   Core 24: <https://snapcraft.io/core24>
  
  **Using a base snap**
  
  Base snaps are installed automatically when a snap package requires them.
  Only one of each type of base snap is ever installed.
  
  Manually removing a base snap may affect the stability of your system.
  
  **Building snaps with core**
  
  Snap developers can use this base in their own snaps by adding the
  following to the snap's snapcraft.yaml:
  
      base: core
