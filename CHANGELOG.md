## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-10

### Security
- **APT `Clean()` now respects `DryRun`**. Previously, `apt autoclean` executed regardless of the `DryRun` option, silently defeating the safety mechanism users expect from dry-run mode. The YUM/Snap/Flatpak Clean implementations already honored DryRun; APT now matches that behavior. Regression tests added in `manager/apt/apt_clean_dryrun_test.go`.
- **Docker test runners no longer mask test failures**. The compose entrypoints used `bash -c` with `&&` chains and trailing `|| true` on fixture-generation steps; due to bash operator precedence, the `|| true` caught failures from earlier in the chain (including `go test`), letting failed tests pass CI silently. Switched to `bash -ec` with explicit `;` separators so test failures abort immediately while fixture-generation steps remain individually allowed to fail.
- Added `read_only: true` and `no-new-privileges:true` to the `test-all` aggregator service for defense-in-depth.

### Changed
- **`PackageInfo` JSON output now uses snake_case field names** (e.g. `package_manager`, `new_version`, `additional_data`) instead of Go's default PascalCase. Required fields (`name`, `status`, `package_manager`) are always emitted; optional fields use `omitempty`. Consumers parsing JSON output must update field names. (#40, thanks @aijanai)

### Fixed
- `go.mod` now declares `go 1.23.0` (full version) instead of `go 1.23`, resolving Go toolchain download failures in some environments. (#40)
